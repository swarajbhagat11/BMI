- I've implemented multiprocessing techniques to execute code in parallel, thereby reducing processing time and maximizing CPU utilization across all cores.
- I've employed binary search to efficiently locate categories based on calculated BMI within a sorted list. This approach optimizes the search process, ensuring swift and accurate categorization.
- We can use Pandas library for enhanced reporting.
